=== DESIGN DOCUMENT ===
This design document is used for documenting and describing the inner workings of the 12Golf
project. As well as describing in detail the user experience over the course of a game.


=== Game Flow ===
Server is started on the server (Single start for multiple instances of the game).
Client is started.
Client automatically tries to connect to "claytonrogers.ca".
If the client can't connect, then it asks for the server.
(Maybe debug mode auto connects to localhost?)
Asks for a username, must be non-null (Future: Remembers username).
It shows the playing field dealt and a message "Please wait for player 2 to connect".
Player 2 connects.
Player 1 goes first, selecting either the face up card, or the deck card.
Player 2's screen shows "Waiting for other players".
Player 1 either replaces a face down card dealt to them, or discards and flips one over.
Then player 2 goes, completing their turn in the same way.
Game ends when one player has all of their cards revealed, other player(s) get one more turn after this.
(Future?) Jokers on the board allow you to switch any two cards.
          (Can you change what a Joker is here? Or any other time other than when it is placed?)
Score is tallied for both players.
    Scoring works as follows:
        - Cards are worth face value, except for the kings, which are worth zero.
        - Jacks are worth 11, Queens 12.
        - Cards which are a pair in a given vertical column are worth zero.
        - Pairs of kings in a vertical column are worth negative zero.
        - (Future) Jokers can be anything you want, you must choose when you put them down.
          (or CPU will automatically choose to give you a pair, except when the other card is un-flipped?)
Final game state is shown for both players along with Score Screen button.
Clicking Score Screen button shows the Score Screen to that player.
Score Screen also contains a Next Round button, which will take the player to the next round.
If the other player has not pressed Next Round,
    the message "Waiting for other player(s) to join next round" will be displayed.
Next round will continue as the first round did.
Ten rounds total are played.
When the last round is played, the button on the score screen will be Exit
        instead of Next Round, which will close the app.
Future: there will also be a rematch and a new game button.
